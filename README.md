# Exploring Mapping for FAIMS3

* display a map - sounds simple and we did that in the elaboration prototype with leaflet
* overlay some data points (labelled GPS points) or vectors (paths) on the map
* capture current location and overlay on map
* display a map with tiles from somewhere other than eg. openstreetmap: display a georeferenced image as the map
* be able to enter new points by touching the map or vectors by drawing lines on the map
